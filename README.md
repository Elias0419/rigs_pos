This software runs a single point-of-sale terminal at RIGS in Wakefield, RI. Itâ€™s also a learning project for me - I needed some lofty goal to motivate myself to learn about software development. As such, the code is rife with spaghetti, poor and unsafe programming practices, and varies wildly in fit and finish.

It uses Kivy and KivyMD for GUI widgets and is designed to run on a Linux system. A few things depend on Linux, particularly the installation program and interactions with hardware like printers and barcode scanners.

This project incorporates code from [barcode_scanner_python](https://github.com/vpatron/barcode_scanner_python) by Vince Patron, which is licensed under the MIT License.
